Hi, I'm **_Ahmad Akhus Syuj'an_** | _اَحْمَدْ اَخُ الشُّجْعَانْ_ | **_Jan_**,  
from the charming town of Lumajang, Indonesia.  
By day, I code in binary, by night, I conquer the internet with my meme mastery.  
My keyboard doubles as a dance floor and I can debug with my eyes closed (not recommended, but impressive nonetheless).  
When I'm not saving the world from bugs and glitches, you can find me sharing laughter with my online friends or searching for the next viral meme.  
So, sit back, grab a meme, and let's geek out together.
