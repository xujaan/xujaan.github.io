title: Nahdlatul Ulama's Balanced Approach to Tobacco Use in Indonesia
---

Tobacco smoking has a long and complex history that dates back to the 16th century when the practice was first introduced to Europe from the Americas. The use of tobacco quickly spread throughout the world and became a popular form of recreation and relaxation. Today, smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease, and is associated with a wide range of health problems including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses.

In the Islamic world, the use of tobacco has been a subject of debate and controversy for many centuries. While some Islamic scholars have permitted the use of tobacco, others have condemned it as harmful and against the teachings of Islam. The Islamic religion places a strong emphasis on maintaining good health and avoiding harmful substances, and this has led some scholars to view smoking as contrary to these principles.

One of the main arguments against smoking in Islam is the belief that it is harmful to one's health. The Prophet Muhammad is recorded as saying, "There should be no harm nor reciprocal harm," and this principle is often cited as a reason for avoiding smoking. Additionally, the Islamic religion places a strong emphasis on preserving life and protecting the health of oneself and others, and this has led some scholars to view smoking as contrary to these principles.

Another argument against smoking in Islam is the belief that it is a form of waste and extravagance. The Islamic religion places a strong emphasis on avoiding waste and living a simple and modest life, and this has led some scholars to view smoking as contrary to these principles. Additionally, the high cost of smoking and the negative impact it has on the environment and public health have led some scholars to view it as a form of social and environmental harm.

Despite these arguments, smoking remains a controversial and widely debated topic in the Islamic world. While some scholars and communities have taken a strong stance against smoking, others have been more permissive and have allowed it as long as it is done in moderation and without causing harm to oneself or others.

Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), one of the largest Islamic organizations in Indonesia, has a unique and influential role in shaping the views of the Indonesian Muslim community on various issues, including smoking. NU is known for its moderate and inclusive approach to Islam and its focus on promoting peace and harmony within Indonesian society.

Regarding smoking, NU has taken a stance that is both cautious and pragmatic. While the organization recognizes the negative health impacts of smoking, it also recognizes that tobacco is a legal product and that smokers should not be treated as outcasts. NU has encouraged its members and the wider Indonesian Muslim community to be mindful of their health and the impact of smoking on others, and to adopt a responsible and moderate approach to smoking.

NU has also taken a strong stance against the marketing and promotion of tobacco products to children and young people, and has encouraged the government to take steps to limit the availability of tobacco to minors. The organization has also been involved in various anti-smoking campaigns and has worked to raise awareness of the dangers of smoking, especially among young people.

In addition to its efforts to promote responsible and moderate smoking, NU has also been involved in efforts to support smokers who wish to quit. The organization has offered counseling and support services to help smokers overcome their addiction and has encouraged the government to provide more resources and support for those who are trying to quit.

Overall, the views of Nahdlatul Ulama on smoking reflect the organization's commitment to promoting peace, harmony, and well-being within Indonesian society. While NU recognizes the negative health impacts of smoking, it also recognizes the importance of treating smokers with respect and compassion and providing them with support and resources to help them quit. Through its approach to smoking, NU continues to play a critical role in shaping the views and behaviors of the Indonesian Muslim community.

In conclusion, the history of tobacco smoking and Islamic views on cigarettes is a complex and multifaceted issue, with many different perspectives and interpretations. While some Islamic scholars view smoking as harmful and contrary to the teachings of Islam, others are more permissive and allow it in moderation. Ultimately, the decision to smoke or not to smoke is a personal one, and should be guided by a deep understanding of the religious and health implications of this practice.
