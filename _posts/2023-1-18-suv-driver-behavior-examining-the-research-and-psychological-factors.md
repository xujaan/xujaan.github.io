title: SUV Driver Behavior&#58; Examining the Research and Psychological Factors
---

Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) have become a popular mode of transportation in recent years, leading to a growing interest in the driving behavior of SUV drivers. While some people believe that SUV drivers are more aggressive or prone to engaging in risky driving behaviors, research on the topic has produced mixed results.

One study, conducted by M.J. Kelly and published in the Journal of Automotive Engineering in 2003, found that SUV drivers were more likely to engage in aggressive driving behaviors, such as tailgating, cutting off other drivers, and making rude gestures. However, another study, conducted by J. Stutts et al. and published in the Journal of Safety Research in 2003, found no significant difference in the aggressive or risky driving behaviors of SUV drivers compared to drivers of other types of vehicles.

In a different approach, K.M. Sandt et al., in their study published in the Journal of Safety Research in 2007, looked at the attitudes and perceptions of SUV drivers. They found that drivers of SUVs had different attitudes towards their vehicles and driving, and that these attitudes were associated with different driving behaviors.

Psychological factors can also play a role in a person's driving behavior, including their personality, beliefs, and attitudes. For example, a person with a high need for control or power may be more likely to engage in aggressive driving behaviors, while a person with a more laid-back personality may be more likely to adopt a more passive driving style. Additionally, a person's beliefs about the safety and security of their vehicle can also influence their driving behavior.

SUV drivers may feel a sense of power and control behind the wheel of their large vehicle, which can lead to a more assertive driving style. This can also be influenced by the perception of SUVs as being safe and secure, leading drivers to feel a false sense of invincibility while on the road. On the other hand, the height and size of SUVs can also make them feel more visible and noticeable on the road, leading drivers to feel more self-conscious and cautious while driving.

It's important to keep in mind that these are just some of the psychological factors that can influence a person's driving behavior, and that other factors, such as driving experience and situational factors, can also play a role. Additionally, these psychological factors can interact with each other and with other factors, such as the type of vehicle being driven, to influence a person's driving behavior in complex and nuanced ways.

Overall, while research on the driving behavior of SUV drivers has produced mixed results, it's clear that psychological factors can play a role in a person's driving behavior. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay of factors that influence a person's driving behavior, and to help promote safe and responsible driving habits for all drivers, regardless of the type of vehicle they are driving.

In conclusion, while the driving behavior of SUV drivers is a complex issue that is influenced by a variety of factors, including psychological factors such as personality, beliefs, and attitudes, research has produced mixed results. Further research is needed to fully understand this topic, and all drivers should practice safe and responsible driving habits, regardless of the type of vehicle they are driving.
